# (Repository) Index

Lots of project names where the title might not always be useful. Here is a list of my work (worth mentioning) with a brief description :)

## Bash

* [sqlup](https://github.com/tschf/odl) - Upgrader for SQLcl. Depends on `odl`.

## Go

* [odl](https://github.com/tschf/odl) - Oracle Download Utility; Support for downloading Oracle installation media from the command line

## PL/SQL

* [pafs](https://github.com/tschf/pafs) - API for Stripe; proof of concept to get it working with PL/SQL. Didn't do much beyond issuing a charge.
* [pldu](https://github.com/tschf/pldu) (du) - dev util; Useful functions when developing a data model. Currently only has a drop_table function which removes table/sequence if it exists.
* [plgapi](https://github.com/tschf/pl-gapi) - API for working with Google APIs. Has some Drive, and Calendar implementations - can be extended with the framework easily enough
